**A configurable Chromium browser for automation, compatibility testing, and reproducible browser-identity experiments.**

Chromix combines source-level Chromium patches with Python and Node.js SDKs. Use familiar Playwright objects, keep a stable profile across sessions, and configure language, timezone, display, and other browser-visible properties from one launch configuration. A separate Node entry point supports Puppeteer.

A **persona** is the browser identity configuration used for a launch. Its reported values, actual browser behavior, and underlying device capabilities have separate verification requirements. Chromix tracks those boundaries in [FINGERPRINT_STATUS.md](FINGERPRINT_STATUS.md); website-specific detection outcomes depend on more than browser configuration.

## Quick start

Choose a language below. The SDK resolves a locally configured executable first; otherwise it downloads and caches the browser selected by its **configured release channel**.

> The SDK's `latest` channel is a pinned mapping, separate from GitHub's Latest release. For a specific release such as `v154.0.8037.97`, download its package and set `CLOAKBROWSER_BINARY_PATH`, or use the pinned [Docker image](docs/docker.md). Updating an SDK does not replace an explicitly configured browser.

### Python

Requires Python 3.8+ according to the package metadata; your Playwright version must also support your Python version.

```bash
python -m pip install chromix playwright
```

On Linux, install Playwright's system dependencies if needed:

```bash
python -m playwright install-deps chromium
```

```python
from chromix import launch

browser = launch(headless=True)
try:
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto("https://example.com")
    print(page.title())
finally:
    browser.close()
```

Use `launch_async`, `launch_context` or `launch_persistent_context` for other lifecycles. See the [Python API guide](sdk/python/README.md). To use this checkout's SDK, install `./sdk/python` in place of `chromix`.

### Node.js / Playwright

Requires Node.js 18+ according to the package metadata; choose a compatible automation-driver version. The npm package is **`@xiaoxiaofeihh/chromix`**. The unscoped `chromix` name belongs to an unrelated project.

```bash
npm install @xiaoxiaofeihh/chromix playwright-core
```

Save as `example.mjs`, then run `node example.mjs`:

```javascript
import { launch } from "@xiaoxiaofeihh/chromix";

const browser = await launch({ headless: true });
try {
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto("https://example.com");
  console.log(await page.title());
} finally {
  await browser.close();
}
```

### Node.js / Puppeteer

```bash
npm install @xiaoxiaofeihh/chromix puppeteer-core
```

Use the separate driver entry point:

```javascript
import { launch } from "@xiaoxiaofeihh/chromix/puppeteer";

const browser = await launch({ headless: true });
try {
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto("https://example.com");
  console.log(await page.title());
} finally {
  await browser.close();
}
```

Driver-specific options and context ownership are explained in the [Node API guide](sdk/node/README.md). Python provides Playwright integration.

### Docker / Linux

The published Docker release provides **`154.0.8037.97` for both amd64 and arm64** under `latest` and `154.0.8037.97`. Docker's `amd64` platform selects the release's `linux-x64` archive; `arm64` selects `linux-arm64`.

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/xiaozhou26/chromix:latest
docker run --rm ghcr.io/xiaozhou26/chromix:latest --version
```

`latest` selects the matching architecture at `154.0.8037.97`; the existing `154.0.8037.57` tag remains unchanged for both architectures. The image is a non-root browser CLI; SDKs and a remote browser service are separate. See [Docker setup and commands](docs/docker.md) for checksum verification, sandbox requirements and headless use. The image build reuses release binaries rather than compiling Chromium again.

## Common configurations

### Persistent profiles

Use one user-data directory per identity. The SDK stores a seed with the profile so subsequent launches reuse it.

```python
from chromix import launch_persistent_context

context = launch_persistent_context(
    "./profiles/demo",
    headless=False,
    locale="en-US",
    timezone="America/New_York",
)
try:
    page = context.new_page()
    page.goto("https://example.com")
finally:
    context.close()
```

Node uses `launchPersistentContext({ userDataDir: "./profiles/demo", ... })`. Keep concurrent browser processes on separate profile directories. For reproducible nonpersistent tests, pass an explicit `args=["--fingerprint=42"]` (Python) or `args: ["--fingerprint=42"]` (Node).

### Proxy and GeoIP

```python
import os
from chromix import launch

browser = launch(
    proxy=os.environ["CHROMIX_PROXY"],
    geoip=True,
    locale="en-US",
    headless=True,
)
try:
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto("https://example.com")
finally:
    browser.close()
```

Set `CHROMIX_PROXY` to your proxy URL, for example `http://user:pass@proxy.example:8080`. Explicit locale/timezone settings take precedence over GeoIP results. GeoIP makes a metadata request through the effective proxy.

Authenticated SOCKS5 TCP requires a matching patched Chromix binary. WebRTC address presentation and actual traffic routing are separate: changing a candidate IP does not create a UDP tunnel. Read the [WebRTC/proxy contract](docs/fingerprint-flags.md#webrtc-ip-and-proxy-resolution) before relying on a particular network route.

### Input timing and extensions

Add `humanize=True` in Python or `humanize: true` in Node to enable the SDK's input helpers. Python accepts `extension_paths`; Node uses `extensionPaths`. Consult the SDK guides for the supported operations, presets and driver-specific restrictions. Input helpers do not establish website-specific detection guarantees.

## Downloads and platforms

Download ZIPs and their checksum files from the **same release**. **Windows x64 / ARM64 and Linux x64 / ARM64 downloads use [v154.0.8037.97](https://github.com/xiaozhou26/Chromix/releases/tag/v154.0.8037.97)**. Only macOS x64 / ARM64 downloads retain [v154.0.8037.57](https://github.com/xiaozhou26/Chromix/releases/tag/v154.0.8037.57) until their newer packages are published.

| Target | Archive | Manual launcher inside the extracted directory |
|---|---|---|
| Windows x64 | [`chromix-win-x64.zip`](https://github.com/xiaozhou26/Chromix/releases/download/v154.0.8037.97/chromix-win-x64.zip) | `chromix/chromix.cmd` |
| Windows ARM64 | [`chromix-win-arm64.zip`](https://github.com/xiaozhou26/Chromix/releases/download/v154.0.8037.97/chromix-win-arm64.zip) | `chromix/chromix.cmd` |
| Linux x64 / Docker amd64 | [`chromix-linux-x64.zip`](https://github.com/xiaozhou26/Chromix/releases/download/v154.0.8037.97/chromix-linux-x64.zip) | `chromix/chromix` |
| Linux ARM64 | [`chromix-linux-arm64.zip`](https://github.com/xiaozhou26/Chromix/releases/download/v154.0.8037.97/chromix-linux-arm64.zip) | `chromix/chromix` |
| macOS Intel | [`chromix-mac-x64.zip`](https://github.com/xiaozhou26/Chromix/releases/download/v154.0.8037.57/chromix-mac-x64.zip) | `chromix/chromix` |
| macOS Apple Silicon | [`chromix-mac-arm64.zip`](https://github.com/xiaozhou26/Chromix/releases/download/v154.0.8037.57/chromix-mac-arm64.zip) | `chromix/chromix` |

Platforms build and publish independently. Windows ARM64 cross-compiles on `windows-2022` and uses `windows-11-arm` for native verification. macOS bundles have no Developer ID distribution signature or notarization. Linux needs compatible system libraries and a working Chromium sandbox.

**Checksum files may be platform-specific.** For `v154.0.8037.97`, Linux x64 uses `SHA256SUMS`, while Linux ARM64 uses `SHA256SUMS-linux-arm64`. Windows x64 uses [`SHA256SUMS-win-x64`](https://github.com/xiaozhou26/Chromix/releases/download/v154.0.8037.97/SHA256SUMS-win-x64); its ZIP is also listed in the same release's main [`SHA256SUMS`](https://github.com/xiaozhou26/Chromix/releases/download/v154.0.8037.97/SHA256SUMS). Windows ARM64 uses [`SHA256SUMS-win-arm64`](https://github.com/xiaozhou26/Chromix/releases/download/v154.0.8037.97/SHA256SUMS-win-arm64). Select the file containing your exact ZIP name; do not assume the generic manifest lists every platform.

Linux x64 example, after downloading both files:

```bash
set -eu
archive=chromix-linux-x64.zip
awk -v name="$archive" '$2 == name || $2 == "*" name { print; count++ } END { if (count != 1) exit 1 }' SHA256SUMS > SHA256SUMS.selected
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.selected
unzip "$archive" -d chromix-linux-x64
./chromix-linux-x64/chromix/chromix --version
```

For Linux ARM64, change the archive/directory to `chromix-linux-arm64` and the manifest to `SHA256SUMS-linux-arm64`. On macOS use `shasum -a 256 -c` and preserve framework symlinks and executable permissions. On Windows use PowerShell `Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256` to compare against the matching manifest before `Expand-Archive`.

For Actions artifacts, first extract GitHub's outer ZIP, then verify the inner browser archive. Detailed candidate verification is in [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md#verify-and-run-a-posix-candidate).

## Use a local browser binary

Set **`CLOAKBROWSER_BINARY_PATH`** in the same terminal as your SDK script. Keep the full extracted bundle next to the executable.

```powershell
# Windows: actual executable, rather than the .cmd launcher
$env:CLOAKBROWSER_BINARY_PATH = "D:\chromix-win-x64\chromix\chrome.exe"
```

```bash
# Linux
export CLOAKBROWSER_BINARY_PATH="/absolute/path/chromix/chrome"

# macOS (use this assignment instead on a Mac)
export CLOAKBROWSER_BINARY_PATH="/absolute/path/chromix/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium"
```

Then use the usual SDK launch functions. This environment variable works in both SDKs. Python `launch(executable_path=...)` conflicts with the wrapper's own argument. Node's ordinary Playwright launches also accept `launchOptions: { executablePath: "/absolute/path/to/chrome" }` to bypass download; the Puppeteer entry point additionally accepts top-level `executablePath`. Measured-device launches have separate restrictions; see the Node guide.

### Versions and download channels

**Python SDK `152.0.7977.82.post4` and Node SDK `0.1.4` are published.** Both Windows architectures and both Linux architectures map `stable` / `latest` to `v154.0.8037.97`. The SDKs also support the Windows release archive's path separators. macOS retains stable `v151.0.7922.173` and latest `v152.0.7977.75`. A local browser can be selected with `CLOAKBROWSER_BINARY_PATH`. Upgrade with `python -m pip install --upgrade chromix` or `npm install @xiaoxiaofeihh/chromix@latest`. SDK package versions remain separate from the browser version.

These are separate version sources:

| Version source | Current checkout | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Linux / Windows source pins | Chromium `154.0.8037.97` | Version compiled by those platform workflows |
| macOS source pin | Chromium `152.0.7977.82` | Independent macOS source baseline |
| Container `latest` / `154.0.8037.97` | amd64 / arm64 `154.0.8037.97` | Both architectures use the same release; the old `.57` tag is retained |
| SDK Linux x64 / ARM64 `stable` / `latest` | [`v154.0.8037.97`](https://github.com/xiaozhou26/Chromix/releases/tag/v154.0.8037.97) | Platform-specific automatic download target |
| SDK Windows x64 `stable` / `latest` | [`v154.0.8037.97`](https://github.com/xiaozhou26/Chromix/releases/tag/v154.0.8037.97) | Published in Python `152.0.7977.82.post3` / Node `0.1.3` |
| SDK Windows ARM64 `stable` / `latest` | [`v154.0.8037.97`](https://github.com/xiaozhou26/Chromix/releases/tag/v154.0.8037.97) | Published in Python `152.0.7977.82.post4` / Node `0.1.4` |
| SDK macOS `stable` | [`v151.0.7922.173`](https://github.com/xiaozhou26/Chromix/releases/tag/v151.0.7922.173) | Existing mapping retained; check asset availability |
| SDK macOS `latest` | [`v152.0.7977.75`](https://github.com/xiaozhou26/Chromix/releases/tag/v152.0.7977.75) | Existing mapping retained; check asset availability |

Source pins are authoritative in [build/ungoogled-revisions.psd1](build/ungoogled-revisions.psd1); channel mappings are in the [Python](sdk/python/chromix/_binary.py) and [Node](sdk/node/_binary.js) downloaders. `CLOAKBROWSER_VERSION` accepts a configured major or an exact four-part release version; an explicit channel takes precedence. Exact versions fail if the requested platform asset is absent. A source feature requires a browser built with the corresponding patches; an SDK update alone cannot add it to an older executable. The Windows ARM64 `.97` package reuses the natively reverified 216-patch build; it does not include the new noise changes in the current source.

## Feature scope and verification

- **Identity settings:** supported flags and defaults are listed in the [flag reference](docs/fingerprint-flags.md). Screen size and page viewport are separate settings.
- **GPU behavior:** the default uses the shared native policy. Identity templates and measured device records have different admission requirements; see [GPU backend](docs/gpu-backend.md) and [device pool](docs/device-pool.md).
- **Experimental controls:** runtime suppression and the remote Canvas bridge are opt-in. The bridge's unsafe mode changes renderer sandboxing; read the [patch documentation](patches/README.md) before enabling it.
- **Evidence:** [fingerprint acceptance](docs/fingerprint-acceptance.md) describes checks against the exact built executable. Unit tests, source patches, browser startup and full runtime acceptance establish different facts.

For a verified local executable, run a focused smoke check:

```bash
python3 tools/fingerprint_smoke.py \
  --browser /absolute/path/chromix/chrome \
  --platform linux --locale en-US \
  --output /tmp/chromix-fingerprint-smoke.json
```

This requires Python Playwright and uses local test pages. It does not download a browser.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | First checks |
|---|---|
| SDK downloads an older browser or returns 404 | Check configured channels and release Assets; use `CLOAKBROWSER_BINARY_PATH` for the exact build you downloaded |
| A flag has no visible effect | Confirm the executable version and relevant source feature; distinguish profile settings from native device capabilities |
| Linux fails to start | Check system libraries, sandbox support, user permissions and shared memory in containers |
| Headed mode fails on a server | Use headless mode or configure a display server |
| Proxy/GeoIP fails | Check credentials, DNS, protocol and metadata reachability through that proxy; explicit locale/timezone can avoid a GeoIP dependency |
| Windows crashes on reload | Follow [Windows crash diagnostics](docs/windows-crash-diagnostics.md) and record the exact executable/build |
| A GitHub build fails | Reuse the latest verified uploaded file-tree checkpoint; see [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) for exact run/stage/attempt/asset inputs |

When reporting an issue, include OS/architecture, browser version, SDK version, launch options with credentials removed, build/run link, and a minimal reproduction.

## Build and contribute

The repository pins Chromium, ungoogled core and platform overlays, then applies the Chromix stack from [patches/series](patches/series). See [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) for per-platform dependencies and staged GitHub Actions builds.

Windows needs Visual Studio C++ tools and Windows SDK **10.0.28000.0**, including Debugging Tools, plus Python, Git, PowerShell 7 and 7-Zip. Linux and macOS require their respective Chromium toolchains. Build caches restore source and intermediate outputs; Ninja recompiles outputs affected by changed inputs.

```powershell
pwsh build/windows/build.ps1 -WorkDir D:\chromix-build -Jobs 8
# Continue with the same work directory:
pwsh build/windows/build.ps1 -WorkDir D:\chromix-build -Resume -Jobs 8
```

Useful development checks, with the appropriate development dependencies installed:

```bash
python3 tools/check_patches.py
python3 -m unittest discover -s tools/tests -v
npm --prefix sdk/node test
git diff --check
```
